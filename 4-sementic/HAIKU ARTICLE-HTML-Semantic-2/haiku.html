		<h2>Rules for Writing Haiku</h2>

		<p> While some forms of poetry have free rein with regard to their subject or number of lines and syllables, the
			haiku was
			established in Japan as far back as the 9th century with a specific structure, style, and philosophy. Many poets
			still
			write in the original 5-7-5 syllable pattern and follow the traditional rules for writing haiku.</p>

		<h2>Style of Haiku Poetry</h2>

		<p> What is a haiku? It is a three-line, beautifully descriptive, form of poetry, intended to be read in one breath.
			If read
			in Japanese, most traditional haiku would have five syllables, or sounds, in the first line, seven in the second,
			and
			five in the last. The Academy of American Poets asserts, "As the form evolved, many of these rules - including the
			5-7-5
			practice - have routinely been broken. However, the philosophy of haiku has been preserved: the focus on a brief
			moment
			in time; a use of provocative, colorful images; an ability to be read in one breath; and a sense of sudden
			enlightenment
			and illumination."</p>

		<h2>Steps for Writing a Haiku</h2>

		<article>
			<p> Even though there are specific rules for writing a traditional haiku, the process can still be fun and
				rewarding. And
				remember that a modern haiku can be more freeform.

				If you are wondering how to write a haiku for the first time, consider the following steps:

			</p>
			<!--- Link problemi -->
			<ol>
				<li> Begin by reading examples of haiku - <a href="#examples"> there are some below </a> - to help you get
					inspired about the subjects and
					construction
					of haiku. A haiku is a beautiful form of poetry, so take time to appreciate it before you begin writing it.
					You
					can find
					more examples of haiku poems on <a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/">YourDictionary</a> or in your local
					library.</li>

				<li>Create a list of possible subjects that you might write about, considering various aspects of nature that
					inspire you.
					Consider traditional subjects like animals, nature, and seasons, or something completely different. Even the
					smallest
					details can make for great haiku.</li>

				<li>After you choose a subject, you may want to look at a few pictures of it, or go outside and admire it. Like
					all of the
					great poets before you, some of the greatest inspiration comes from simply admiring nature and the world
					around
					them.</li>

				<li> Make a list of words that relate to the subject you have chosen. Be as descriptive as possible. Think about
					feelings and
					emotions too.</li>

				<li> The last line is usually used to make an observation about your subject. It can be fun to add a surprise
					here. Looking
					through the list you wrote, can you create an unexpected relationship between the first two lines and the
					third?</li>

				<li> Decide if you want to write using the 5-7-5 rule or branch outside the limits of this pattern. <em> (If you
						have
						trouble
						determining the syllables in a word because you are not sure how to pronounce it, you can look up the word
						here
						on
						YourDictionary for a count of the syllables.)</em>,</li>
			</ol>

		<h2>Examples of Traditional Haiku</h2>
		<article>
			<p> The most famed traditional Japanese poets include Matsuo Basho, Yosa Buson, Kobayashi Issa, and Masoaka Shiki.
				They
				are
				known as "the Great Four" and their work is still the model for traditional haiku writing today.</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>	An old silent pond,<br>
				A frog jumps into the pond,<br>
				splash! Silence again.<br>
				On a withered branch <br>
				A crow has alighted: <br>
				Nightfall in autumn. <br>
				- Matsuo Basho
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p> The traditional form of haiku has also been embraced by English-speaking poets. Here are two examples by Kelly
				Roper
				from our sister site <a href="https://www.LoveToKnow.com"> LoveToKnow.com,</a> both with a focus on nature.</p>
			<blockquote>
				The season gives way. <br>
				Winter lays down her mantle, <br>
				As spring bursts to life <br>
				Waiting in the marsh, <br>
				The heron stands silently, <br>
				Fish sense death is near. <br>
				- Kelly Roper
