  <p>“As of June, everyone has already started counting down little by little to leave the city. May it be my turn now! :) To work; I'm starting off with a beach bag that doesn't contain anything about the beach yet. 🙂 Let's see when that ticket will be bought, that beach bag, that holiday suitcase will be filled?”</p>

  <p>“We opened the Alaçatı season early this time, in the first week of April. April, May and September are actually the best times to enjoy Alaçatı. Today's shots come from a day I enjoyed this beautiful getaway with my first strappy dress of the season, straw hat and my spring”</p>

  <p>“After the Youtube videos, I start with the award ceremonies that fly me all the way from Istanbul to America, with lots of photos in Los Angeles posts. In Los Angeles, there are almost 2-3 invitations, ceremonies, parties with plenty of Hollywood stars a week. Jetlag because now I get to go to bed hours a Hollywood star, can follow a tight squeeze all from Instagram 😉 <em>FOXLIFE Turkey</em> I found a chance of joining the invitation of the <em>People's Choice Awards</em>  'm starting with those own viewfinder to hang out the night then 🙂”
